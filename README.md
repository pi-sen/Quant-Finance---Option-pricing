Overview
This Python project provides a framework for pricing options using various quantitative finance techniques. The primary focus is on implementing and comparing different option pricing models, including the Black-Scholes model and Monte Carlo simulations.

Features
Black-Scholes Model: Calculate European option prices based on the Black-Scholes formula.
Monte Carlo Simulation: Estimate option prices using Monte Carlo methods.
Greeks Calculation: Compute Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho) for options.
Custom Pricing Models: Implement and test additional pricing models as needed.
