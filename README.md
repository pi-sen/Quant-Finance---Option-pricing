#Overview

This Python project provides a framework for pricing options using various quantitative finance techniques. The primary focus is on implementing and comparing different option pricing models, including the Black-Scholes model and Monte Carlo simulations.

There are three parts to this project - 

1. Simulating Stock price using the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)
2. Pricing European Options using GBM and analytical Black Scholes formula
3. Pricing American Options using Monte Carlo simulation
4. Pricing American option using QuantLib
